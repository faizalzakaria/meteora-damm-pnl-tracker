## Smart Profit Taking

The `take-profit` command intelligently handles your withdrawals:

# If you have $200 invested and take $300 profit:
./damm-pnl take-profit aixbt 300.00

# Result:
#  Capital reduction: $200.00 (your invested amount)
#  Pure profit: $100.00 (profit beyond investment)
#  Total invested: $200.00 ï¿½ $0.00
```

- How much capital you've recovered
- How much pure profit you've extracted
- Realistic PnL calculations
